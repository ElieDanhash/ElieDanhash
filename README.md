## More about me:
Creative, ambitious, and self-motivated mobile software engineer. Although I have studied Computing & IT since secondary school, my skills are not due to a fancy education, but rather the result of extensive practical experience over more than 9 years, which has given me a strong technical background in many programming languages.
My interest in mobile app development tracks back to 2013 when I built and published my first app. Since then, I have been passionate about mobile app development and have successfully published more than 20 apps, blending my academic background in Computing & IT with my enthusiasm for programming to create diverse and impactful solutions.
Iâ€™ve successfully led mobile teams at two companies, where I not only guided projects to success but also cultivated a culture of innovation and excellence within the teams.
